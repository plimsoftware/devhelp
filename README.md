This project was built with Electron and React.<br />

With so many technologies available (Node, React, Javascript, ...), I created a small tool to put together various topics to help me remember.<br />

For example, I create the "React" category. Then I create the topic "Install" and then I have it available to create the body of the topic, comment boxes and boxes with code format.<br />

# Version 1.4.0

Added help to write comments with markdown.

### Version 1.3.1

Now comments accept markdown tags.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app on a Electron Window in the development mode.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

Then creates a build in Electron in `dist` folder.<br />
Will be available two versions. One Install version and one already unpacked.<br />

### `react-start and react-build`

These scripts will be used by start and build.
